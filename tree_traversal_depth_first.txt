Tree Traversal Depth First:

This is a technique used to traverse non-linear iterations.

Starting with the parent object as the current item, loop
through the children elements determining the number of 
children, the current depth, and the value held by each 
child.

For each child in the loop, recursively call the function
that is analysing the parent object and passing the each
child element as the new current object.
